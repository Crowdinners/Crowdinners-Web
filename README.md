Crowdinners Website/Backend
===================

# Note

This is the code that powered the website and backend services of the former [Overcast/Lifeboat PC Network](https://discord.gg/6zGDEen).

Besides the removal of some branding and configuration data, it is more or less unmodified.
It is probably not *directly* useful to third parties in its current state,
but it may be help in understanding how the [ProjectAres](https://github.com/OvercastNetwork/ProjectAres) plugins work.

The current Crowdinners-Web repository comes from the publicly available, yet archived [Stratus Network's repository](https://github.com/StratusNetwork/web), which has been the organization maintaining it for the past years since the original release of the source code by the former Overcast Network.

# Original README

The original readme's content can be found [here](https://github.com/OvercastNetwork/OCN/blob/master/README.md). I did not want to keep all of that information within this readme, as many functions which pertain to the original codebase may be subject to change, and therefore make the readme's information misleading and even useless at some point.
